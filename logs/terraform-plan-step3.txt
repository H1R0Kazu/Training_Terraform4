Terraform used the selected providers to generate the following execution
plan. Resource actions are indicated with the following symbols:
  + create

Terraform will perform the following actions:

  # aws_vpc_security_group_ingress_rule.allow_https will be created
  + resource "aws_vpc_security_group_ingress_rule" "allow_https" {
      + arn                    = (known after apply)
      + cidr_ipv4              = "0.0.0.0/0"
      + description            = "Allow HTTPS from anywhere (using aws_vpc_security_group_ingress_rule)"
      + from_port              = 443
      + id                     = (known after apply)
      + ip_protocol            = "tcp"

    }

Plan: 1 to add, 0 to change, 0 to destroy.

Note: You didn't use the -out option to save this plan, so Terraform can't
guarantee to take exactly these actions if you run "terraform apply" now.
