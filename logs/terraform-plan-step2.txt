Terraform used the selected providers to generate the following execution
plan. Resource actions are indicated with the following symbols:
  + create

Terraform will perform the following actions:

  # aws_security_group_rule.allow_http will be created
  + resource "aws_security_group_rule" "allow_http" {
      + cidr_blocks              = [
          + "0.0.0.0/0",
        ]
      + description              = "Allow HTTP from anywhere (using aws_security_group_rule)"
      + from_port                = 80
      + id                       = (known after apply)
      + protocol                 = "tcp"
      + security_group_id        = "sg-04ad30f8c2f96a412"

      + type                     = "ingress"
    }

Plan: 1 to add, 0 to change, 0 to destroy.

Note: You didn't use the -out option to save this plan, so Terraform can't
guarantee to take exactly these actions if you run "terraform apply" now.
